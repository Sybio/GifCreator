TODO:

! Allow image dirs within the input list (array), too, not only instead of it.

! In local testing I had a strange issue with by-frame delays: the first image eats
  up the first two delays, and is shown for the sum of those two numbers... :-o
  -> And I seem to be unable to reproduce it now! :-o

* Warn about explicit sorting if per-frame delays are specified for a dir source?

* Sync the index.php (demo & quickstart frontend) with the examples in README.md 
  AND ALSO THE ONE AT SO!

* To avoid unwanted "in-band" PHP output, I should probably disable display_errors()
  in the whole module (restoring it on normal exit)...
